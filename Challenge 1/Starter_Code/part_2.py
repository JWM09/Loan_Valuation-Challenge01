"""Part 2: Analyze Loan Data.

Analyze the loan to determine the investment evaluation.

Using more detailed data on one of these loans, follow these steps to calculate a Present Value, or a "fair price" for what this loan would be worth.

1. Use get() on the dictionary of additional information to extract the **Future Value** and **Remaining Months** on the loan.
    a. Save these values as variables called `future_value` and `remaining_months`.
    b. Print each variable.

    @NOTE:
    **Future Value**: The amount of money the borrower has to pay back upon maturity of the loan (a.k.a. "Face Value")
    **Remaining Months**: The remaining maturity (in months) before the loan needs to be fully repaid.

2. Use the formula for Present Value to calculate a "fair value" of the loan. Use a minimum required return of 20% as the discount rate.
3. Write a conditional statement (an if-else statement) to decide if the present value represents the loan's fair value.
    a. If the present value of the loan is greater than or equal to the cost, then print a message that says the loan is worth at least the cost to buy it.
    b. Else, the present value of the loan is less than the loan cost, then print a message that says that the loan is too expensive and not worth the price.

    @NOTE:
    If Present Value represents the loan's fair value (given the required minimum return of 20%), does it make sense to buy the loan at its current cost?

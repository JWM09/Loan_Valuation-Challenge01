"""Part 1: Automate the Calculations.

Automate the calculations for the loan portfolio summaries.

First, let's start with some calculations on a list of prices for 5 loans.
    1. Use the `len` function to calculate the total number of loans in the list.
    2. Use the `sum` function to calculate the total of all loans in the list.
    3. Using the sum of all loans and the total number of loans, calculate the average loan price.
    4. Print all calculations with descriptive messages.
"""
loan_costs = [500, 600, 200, 1000, 450]

# How many loans are in the list?
# @TODO: Use the `len` function to calculate the total number of loans in the list.
# Print the number of loans from the list
# YOUR CODE HERE!
number_of_loans = len(loan_costs)
print(f"There are {number_of_loans} in this portfolio.")

# What is the total of all loans?
# @TODO: Use the `sum` function to calculate the total of all loans in the list.
# Print the total value of the loans
# YOUR CODE HERE!
portfolio_value = sum(loan_costs)
print(f"The value of this portfolio is ${portfolio_value}.00")

# What is the average loan amount from the list?
# @TODO: Using the sum of all loans and the total number of loans, calculate the average loan price.
# Print the average loan amount
# YOUR CODE HERE!
average_value = portfolio_value / number_of_loans
print(f"The average loan value in this portfolio is ${average_value: .2f}.")

"""Part 2: Analyze Loan Data.

Analyze the loan to determine the investment evaluation.

Using more detailed data on one of these loans, follow these steps to calculate a Present Value, or a "fair price" for what this loan would be worth.

1. Use get() on the dictionary of additional information to extract the **Future Value** and **Remaining Months** on the loan.
    a. Save these values as variables called `future_value` and `remaining_months`.
    b. Print each variable.

    @NOTE:
    **Future Value**: The amount of money the borrower has to pay back upon maturity of the loan (a.k.a. "Face Value")
    **Remaining Months**: The remaining maturity (in months) before the loan needs to be fully repaid.

2. Use the formula for Present Value to calculate a "fair value" of the loan. Use a minimum required return of 20% as the discount rate.
3. Write a conditional statement (an if-else statement) to decide if the present value represents the loan's fair value.
    a. If the present value of the loan is greater than or equal to the cost, then print a message that says the loan is worth at least the cost to buy it.
    b. Else, the present value of the loan is less than the loan cost, then print a message that says that the loan is too expensive and not worth the price.

    @NOTE:
    If Present Value represents the loan's fair value (given the required minimum return of 20%), does it make sense to buy the loan at its current cost?
"""

# Given the following loan data, you will need to calculate the present value for the loan

"""Part 3: Perform Financial Calculations.

Perform financial calculations using functions.

1. Define a new function that will be used to calculate present value.
    a. This function should include parameters for `future_value`, `remaining_months`, and the `annual_discount_rate`
    b. The function should return the `present_value` for the loan.
2. Use the function to calculate the present value of the new loan given below.
